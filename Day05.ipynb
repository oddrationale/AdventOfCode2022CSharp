    "<h2>--- Day 5: Supply Stacks ---</h2><p>The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked <em>crates</em>, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.</p>\n",
    "<p>The ship has a <em>giant cargo crane</em> capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her <em>which</em> crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.</p>\n",
    "<p>They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates <em>and</em> the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>    [D]    \n",
    "[N] [C]    \n",
    "[Z] [M] [P]\n",
    " 1   2   3 \n",
    "\n",
    "move 1 from 2 to 1\n",
    "move 3 from 1 to 3\n",
    "move 2 from 2 to 1\n",
    "move 1 from 1 to 2\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate <code>Z</code> is on the bottom, and crate <code>N</code> is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates <code>M</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code>. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, <code>P</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>[D]        \n",
    "[N] [C]    \n",
    "[Z] [M] [P]\n",
    " 1   2   3 \n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved <em>one at a time</em>, so the first crate to be moved (<code>D</code>) ends up below the second and third crates:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>        [Z]\n",
    "        [N]\n",
    "    [C] [D]\n",
    "    [M] [P]\n",
    " 1   2   3\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved <em>one at a time</em>, crate <code>C</code> ends up below crate <code>M</code>:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>        [Z]\n",
    "        [N]\n",
    "[M]     [D]\n",
    "[C]     [P]\n",
    " 1   2   3\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>        [<em>Z</em>]\n",
    "        [N]\n",
    "        [D]\n",
    "[<em>C</em>] [<em>M</em>] [P]\n",
    " 1   2   3\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The Elves just need to know <em>which crate will end up on top of each stack</em>; in this example, the top crates are <code>C</code> in stack 1, <code>M</code> in stack 2, and <code>Z</code> in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message <code><em>CMZ</em></code>.</p>\n",
    "<p><em>After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?</em></p>"
